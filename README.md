# Git Verification

A framework that allows veriying the integrity of a Git repository against rules

**NOTE: This is work in progress**

## Setup
Currently the framework only support running the `verify` command, defined in `verifier/commands/verify.py`. To be able to run this script from any other folder in your system, add this to your `.bashrc`:
```
export PYTHONPATH=path-to-project/verifier
```
The initialization of the framework is not implemented. Thus this must be done manually
